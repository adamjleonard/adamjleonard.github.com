Decision Fatigue
================

**This is a rough version**

Imagine running as fast as you can, sweat dripping from your face, your muscles
are tense and sore, and it’s becoming difficult to take that next step. We are
exerting physical energy and only have a limited supply of it. Each and every
step becomes more difficult and eventually we are unable to continue this
exertion. The same idea can apply to making a decision. When we make decisions
we are drawing from a pool of resources or energy. The less resources we have,
the harder it becomes to make a decision, especially a good decision. This idea
is called decision fatigue.

Decision fatigue in our every day lives
---------------------------------------

When you go to the grocery store, near the counter are snacks, gum, and other
items you can buy. Why is this? It’s because after deciding what to buy
throughout the store, you are more likely to make the decision to buy one of
these items because you are experiencing decision fatigue.

Decision fatigue could prove fatal
----------------------------------

Decision fatigue could even mean something as drastic as life or death for
some. A study of inmates appealing for parole showed that those who appeared at
earlier times received parole 70% more than those who appeared late in the day.
Those who appeared late in the day received parole 10% of the time.

What’s this all mean? You should probably make your most important decisions
early in the day.
