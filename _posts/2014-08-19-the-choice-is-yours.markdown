title: The Choice is Yours - Rough Version
category: posts
---

**This post is just a set of ideas, it's not intended to be the final
post**

Choice is the most powerful of tools that a person can have. YOU choose
to be offended by a strangers remarks, YOU choose to continue to flip
burgers at a job you loathe, YOU choose the perspective you have on
things, and ultimately YOU choose the outcome of the life you live.

It's easy to push the blame on others for your emotional responses. On
the government for your lack of employability. On your past for your
perspectives, and as to why you are not being the person you want to be.

Knowing this we can choose to make the positive choice. When someone
says something that offends you choose to not be offended. Choose to not
let someone else be in control of your emotions. You should be the only
one who ultimately determines how you feel day in and day out.

Choose to leave your job for a better opportunity. Choose to start
learning a new skill that will allow for other opportunities. Start
pursuing your life long passion on the side. Choose to look at your job
as a stepping stone to the path you want to take.

Choose to change your negative perspective on things to positive ones.
When life gives you lemons, reframe the situation. Ask yourself, how can
I make use of these lemons to better my life or myself.

Everything in life is a choice. There's no one with a gun to your head
forcing you to make the decisions that you do.
